# titanic-survival-analysis
Project Overview

• Classification project exploring survival patterns from the Titanic disaster
• Uses the seaborn Titanic dataset (no manual CSV needed)
• Includes EDA, insights, visualizations, and classification modeling

Objectives

• Understand relationships between survival and features like gender, class, and age
• Visualize distributions and correlations
• Train ML models to predict passenger survival
• Evaluate accuracy and classification metrics

Tools Used

• Python
• Pandas
• NumPy
• Seaborn
• Matplotlib
• Scikit-learn
• Jupyter Notebook

Files in This Repository

• titanic_survival_analysis.ipynb — Main notebook
• README.md — Documentation

Dataset Source

• Seaborn built-in dataset: “titanic”
• Automatically loads inside the notebook

Key Insights

• Females had a significantly higher survival rate
• First-class passengers survived more often than lower classes
• Children showed higher survival likelihood
• Fare and class strongly influence survival outcomes

Modeling Summary

• Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest tested
• Good predictive accuracy achieved
• Confusion matrix shows reliable classification results
• Feature importance highlights key survival factors

Business / Historical Interpretations

• Survival decisions were influenced by socio-economic status
• Strong gender bias toward women and children in rescue operations
• Insights reveal patterns consistent with historical accounts

How to Run

• Download the repository
• Open the notebook in Jupyter
• Run all cells (dataset loads automatically through seaborn)
